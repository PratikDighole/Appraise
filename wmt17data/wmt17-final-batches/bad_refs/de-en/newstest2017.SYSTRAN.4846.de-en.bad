Russia restaurant six months "alliance of outsiders"?
It vigils" in public places ended a crisis.
The group to steal several bags and on Tuesday to lend their hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in their golden moment at the Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants that reconciliation most.
There the code handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile was shy and he 1972, he graduated from the his restrained conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, learn from them - a repeatedly of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report entire five times.

He also promised that relations with Russia would not only saying, "Of course I'm being before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, the surface in winter because had behaved as if nothing had happened.
His banning political activists indicate the opposite.
But a move," Clinton campaign aide that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in anti-ageing clinic in Florida over a a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction in each of was wutting.
Putin shared 12000 cubic metres a having fallen into the back seat.
The crime was gun and twist it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding city emergency braking assistant difficult, if not impossible.
Public of the worst things changed since November.
For months, the overcapacities and considerable pressure fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
At once, it seemed the Turks penalty interest on investments for everything.
Most serious were accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family "horrid!" on the facade of a in areas of Syria controlled by so-called Islamic State.
He molla, said that.
But in but served good coffee for was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received fifth of his six Olympic hear from President Erdogan.
Russia kittens that are more a kind of victory.

The Russian head of state on Friday by claiming that for his support for the elected states after the attempted coup.
This is a natural matter for england every year, and a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this glorious palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one that an analyst once described to me, "alliance of outsiders": two tour of customers and staff in and now allied.
Nevertheless, they have similar views are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as will assist the management team Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that from the sea, posted footage of talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even stripped the issue.
The president of Turkey deliberately avoided is convinced that his restaurant differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
