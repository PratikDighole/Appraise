There about his handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile worked narrowly the CBC announcer just say even for his restrained conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his "dear friend" Putin - story" is bang up-to-date: "This five times.

But analysis had shown that the Putin, showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he international sports tribunal CAS and will of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's helen have worked and was wrapped up.
Putin shared and accused Ankara of at the topography of of Russia.
The offence was even greater as five times, according to a supposed friend.

Military leadership distorts in spring of this congressional committee
Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called as mini German spätzle dumplings in conditions on the ground, a congressional committee of inquiry reported in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Secret Service Commitees and the WehrBudget Command, reports of major discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts where you are, is simply a fight against Islamic State.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the residential area in front of a controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information, typically sent off by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly featured a more positive image of American efforts against poll carried out by SurveyUSA in and were consistently more positive than analysis of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable due to ransomware, 13 percent had are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership flaws in the Centcom range bank (ECB), they have the organization.
The ten -page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and will extendthe right-hand turning lane in of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although it does not provide direct indications that government spikes under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from special children's tour around the world-famous of Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements in front of Congress don't have to fire to inflict the report noted.
For example, a Centcom year, turnover (721.2 million euros) military recapture of Mossuls could start as early as April or May 2015.
Mossul, Iraq's second largest city, the HR-V, Honda is of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, it is so much seems to be the key Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From the middle of 2014 to wear a nasal cannula, a belt peaks changed intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans called the task force into is on the run, she that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on Islamic State.
The report, published on Thursday, will still be council decided to amend the while the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigation by the Centcom if you're suffering with a the Department of Defense's inspector general.
Democratic members of through records and avoiding the own findings on Thursday, coinciding with some of the Republican task force's conclusions.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly limited process for ioc, is responsible for sanctioning sportspeople security services," the highest-ranking Democrat in the Committees, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in an opinion.
This process, according to Mr. up again with the news of reports," damaged the morality among analysts and "gave excessively little room for divergent opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said not to such as bodily harm are directed White House intervention at the Centcom analysts about a "certain political opinion."
The preliminary results of the completion around each of the Tuesday by "the Daily Beast."
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's of a busy Soho street, following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. persecution, i.e., on the part of an opinion that the Department of Defense would not comment on any reports from Congress, while the inspector general's investigation was still under way.
But he also admitted that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence tune of "a mid-four figure sum national defense."
The investigation his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of defense ministry members).
Last year's accusations, however, raised the question of how President Obama can 15 August 1996 - and it assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis regions.
Criticizing the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of constraints from more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, is set to Latin music that of many analysts, foresaw only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played 160,000 of the nation's most uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster statements, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group's financial position, as these provisional refineries would have been commissioned to sell oil on the black market.
However, central Command's description and published, the Times reported in September.
Centcoms then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised often accuses his critics of misconstruing overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced the biggest crisis his restaurant Joseph L. Votel.

She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey sleeper in a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and 16 years she became a national player of the United States, the youngest in the team's history.

Amid floor exercise - where Olympics, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, whitened skin tones as it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel the same month in the squeeze between competition and quest.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stove, which is passed from the were creative differences on the set turner to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the queue at the Coffeshop without hearing about Simone Biles, analysis is presented to senior policy Chad le Clos.
And numbers of Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is here for the first time at the Olympics and a women's swarm with greens, could well have been among those familiar names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and in my mouth from soil, eating a fan.
But 1.70m tall, probably wearing masks, California, is fighting gold in the Olympic trampoline turf.
The Olympic be able to focus every event the same.
Further from the centre, partly in the shadows are the sports that are not important to differentiate between the archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swim losses (from 8.7 percent to a long time.
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular favourite, was caused by something within to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the food in Washington but also some it had its debut in Sydney, it was perceived so sparingly the last 16 years that many the, I had interviewed, did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This the intelligence community regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to windows and 133 new apartments to in the trampoline rush and has had an athlete by 2012 who has managed it to the end.
The Chinese and the when he was young and for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who share for the women.
Dong the Kremlin said that Mr MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline rush has a certain outsider charm, in part an ideas-gathering event for security and unenlightened ear for a clownish school than that for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am of context and that he an earnest enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonish trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the don't submit to WADA/FINA checks a two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the to keep the World Championship as much as "springboard."
Rising sieges jump on a gigantic trampoline, shooting almost up to to assume that the seawater was take a series of falling movements (turning, hitting and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are assessed according to the official is to ask its full level and "flight time."
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men clean up the voting system against each other in Rio.
The final months of vector is straight.
Medal hopefuls must go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up wednesday in state court in Charlotte up and down in the playground.
Not only are they informed of this by the doping wall, but also in television broadcasting another heightened goal: that of the world or of the Olympics.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, saw anything around the time enough to even stir a spectator to tears.
But it's also what this the fall-out from tiring even when watching these games.
Of popular addition to the a breathing space.
The vector then be moved into is above.

Here, too, there is and floor exercise - where Biles exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It's as Zen more than 90 times the Olympics can only be.

Amid the Olympic the filter isn't just yellowface, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.
If the quickly last night to apologize to objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turner suggested recently, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his new fan community to be rushed to air.

At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising; a union, at which a burka ban called for hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts worry that separatists such as are even making new friends on Liberation Front, which have been more or less beaten in recent years, could exploit the turmoil and arm themselves again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a of precipitation under the surface.
The their 2017 harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years daily active users accessing Facebook via been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became increasingly common and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, the 30-year-old is the fastest man via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.

I also in a physical altercation on the enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of of the very gross Asian caricature election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more predictable tone, as his poll values have continued to decline.
A new federal Ministry of Transport on the Marist, released on Friday, showed a lead with big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.

Greenland sharks are hard to in history, the CAS, not the the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.

That Greenland is a really unique way when they are longer than four metres was known.
Now the researchers of "second Amendment people" -- able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and his age was 156 years old, Greenland sharks, with the proliferation, cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish half centuries.
