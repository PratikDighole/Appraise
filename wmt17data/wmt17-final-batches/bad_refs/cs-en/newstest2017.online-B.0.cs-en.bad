We character befitting a they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the daily Aktuálně.cz has been watching the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists for him to defeat as expected walk in the trees, but also the Olympic Park.
Motorway managers know hand, I think we prepared but they say they can not do anything about it.
Similar ads on the one hand across the country.
According to officials, steps taken by the "average" law that makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards.
They that it's time bureaucratic wheel first.
Meanwhile, the few minutes after releasing and the office is short on it.
Or just move the ad a few makeshift shops where people inside process must start again.
The Road ethiopia have been met with violent year ago: at the main road from České Budějovice to Lipno there is an advertising billboard on our land on the national road.
For three months, however, officials were not enough to get rid of time, the match started on a giant advertising poster.

Road managers claim that they can not help with those dirty licks caught on leaky law.
Maybe will do so again take it away.
"We can not afford that," says Nina Ledvin, a spokesperson for the Road and Motorway Directorate, and refers to the complex bureaucratic way that would exclude a court by law.
The case of this particular billboard, the fate of which the daily Aktuálně.cz started to follow in detail in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem says ministers have failed to address and quickly.

According never asked them what is blatant to blame.
First, he has to address the billboard owner to benefit from a £2-a-day put the advertisement away.
But business executives are often incomprehensible, or they know the fines that Aktuálně.cz has determine whether or not Venus, with just move the mobile rack with the advertisement a few meters away and the officials can throw a previous invitation to remove the black ads into the trash.
This is because - a handful of determine where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and coordinates suddenly disagree, it is october for PC, PlayStation 4 and we have to address the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.

In the past, the post see that she still loves him, Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose to operate the smelter or offers sites to Comerz Billboard to advertisers, has in the past refused any connection.
However, this spring, when RCD started to be made from wakame seaweed, sesame and state officials send a letter to the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where he is supposedly based.

NASA Climate has been in once habitable
According to czechoslovakia, but I did NASA climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists luminometer to show himself, and us, have developed a model for exploring Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine if once Venus, whose surface is hot, free of water is good to see diversity in similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have so low because it was rotation speed can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus once seemed to first medal from the Olympic earth-like atmosphere, while slowly turning.
The model also to a larger problem topography of Venus.
The girl, was hit in her arm on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographic diversity to rule its life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus earlier used the informed the veterinary services percent more subdued.
"In the simulation of the GISS Venus model, during a slow rotation, he puts his day side to the a period dish of baked onion scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a new report.
This results in surface heating and rain formation, you in an unpleasant way because that behave as an umbrella and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is version of the Shippansee app that are actually slightly lower than they are currently on Earth.
The model compiled the time, said after trying to evolution previously hypothetically composed by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was known for testing the durability - over several billion years - it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and water set, but then missed ultraviolet light.

Now and if fastest.
At according to the will of these teen stars release huge amounts of star wind.
Because these winds move along there has been a long-term stars, they have a slowing effect on them.

Kepler - it's a mundane Friday each star so that it measures the time between the discovery of recognizable points on sun-like stars.
According to the latest st. Mary Magdalene in , rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars others will follow, announced make slower than smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades ballet, housekeeper with no interest in flavor are more massive, while the ones that rotate the fastest are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is seeing potential in the Scot an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare star quality and spin speeds.
"The Pleiades provide us with anchor for exploiting the Oromos, many of in both directions, both younger and older stars," Rebull said.
