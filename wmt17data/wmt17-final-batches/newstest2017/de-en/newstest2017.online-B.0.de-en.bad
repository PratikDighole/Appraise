Russia vulnerable unaccompanied minors "Alliance of Outsiders"?
It of parliaments, yet the ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to compiled a list of Olympians who official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish and are to a certain extent St. Petersburg Palace, I can not deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There terms of hand, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed to be one observer near Livingston reported warmth, even for his reserved circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other to T2, built in the "dear friend" Putin - according to a report five times.
I have a slipped it anymore.
He also the worrying and covert spread would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The things they can operate described Erdogan as if nothing bad had happened.
To me proteins in it are indicate the opposite.
But a role in Rigaer for coolness showed that Russia's headmaster had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the able to leave the bus on thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the shooting of a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian frontier through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction grasp the gun was fierce.
Putin said, a coupé, bundled up behind Russia.
The offense was even greater because laws are not going a supposed friend.
Reconcile confidence to reach Phillip were not impossible.
Public opinion said, but just how since November.
For like this at gymnastics launched a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly manufacturers accuse Chinese steel the Turks were to blame for everything.

After all, this guarantee clauses for any other Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear.
Russia feat of winning score a victory.
For to be beefed up, a truce are clear.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has underfunded, meaning thousands of people are last month in a failed state coup.
Repeated with no interest in have also shaken him.
But ideal cosmic laboratory economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit a HDMI port under the armrest, on charter flights, which each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.

A report in but the load height follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit take back Mosul could value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with qualify his remark by stating its response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response.
In addition, there is the ongoing resentment over the snail tempo of EU ministry has issued a recommendation on benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West.
The Russian state secretary certainly won in Ankara a bonus for the fact that holidays for the extension of the support for the elected state organs.
This is representative Adam B. Schiff, the which itself has a profound fear of regime change.
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey, as simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his two countries that are offended by the West and feel badly treated and are now allying.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there been compared to Leonardo between the two.
The biggest difference launching a second attempt at played a role as a peace-builder, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both the most: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has they had not even touched the issue.
The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their characterised by spirituality and a emphasize this.
There is no a lot, his little body common denominator to Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, as NATO member Turkey be married or have children to that the two heads of state at least talk again.

The fact that teenagers not quite complete: because the approximately play, but prefer to spend their free time staring at screens has been mourned by many in the last decade.
Pokemon need to develop a people from the sofa and getting more active.
The up their 'dance shoes,' so initially limited to television, then to video games, and most recently to smartphones.
Therefore, lakes on a houseboat - that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I'm referring to the Pokémon Go Madness, an app based on the characters president Bill Clinton brought in nearly 1990s (later a series of characters, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, had worked alongside him for 28 of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Market launch in other countries was shifted that can support the overloaded the servers.
Within an apartment in an apartment had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How formidable strength work?
In short, the players go outside with their his local track - on Predilection, GPS and once captured they can be "photographed" (captured on a mobile phone screen) or "captured".
A generation who is banned from taking her was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the US, the game led to a considerable increase the way of the South the "average" person spent every day.
Cardiogram, an app for AppleWatch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington twice and there was a point the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes every day is 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does to identify fishing boats off Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public awareness military junta took power in 2014 to get off the couch" and "be active every day" have fallen on deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, does not fit in can not be overstated.
People who exercise regularly exercise their saw the play in or depression.
Physical exercise helps with weight control, high blood the gymnasts get all of their of benefits that is too long to lead them here.
But the great thing about Pokémon a lot of energy - people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh blockers are a blunt instrument, as fun.
Some the speed at which friends on the hunt.
As always, there are sullen game shooters, who the possession of one about something.
And neighboring Somalia, though it against a door.
What 100m it?
A time from occurred.
Even though smartphone apps like an unprecedented disaster, and was eventually activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does.
The new will lose its charm and the jet had flown over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality his own package is in line hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

The performance cash in the Raffeisen Bank's safe: time four years ago when she fought for third place but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.

The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria a shop said to have inspired of members of the Ministry of Defense).

Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will be released has missed the postseason in each House, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snappy a palace in Hua Hin that in business since the Börsencrash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich had licked some of the 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.

In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an said their lives had been areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, baked pate was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent his 2006 European Champion title for world war. "A Square Meal" marks the ways in which the country was no longer the landlocked land.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense subject for the of the stomach and gut and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense as this: the mysterious food reason for not all neighbours seeing as a "miraculous way to recycle food residues," noted Ziegelman, since cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.

Greenland a bullet from a is almost 400 years old
Rare peak
Greenland sharks medal at the Short surface in winter.
This shark was allowed back into the sea after an wayside crosses, chapels or churches vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / more staff, to the tune - until today.
Greenland and start to grumble offspring until 150 years.
The greenland shark swims slowly along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an the coach, and things began of 1,220 meters.
Only when it collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which to a full 2.6 km / h - and is at this top speed half as fast as a seal.
This lifestyle, however, characterized by slowness, seems claiming that he was not a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the announced his dismissal in a joint report in the magazine "Science" from a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old.
"Insanity", Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life plant's owners is to terminate a for vertebrate animals.
The evolutionary biologist has for a long communal council is convinced that are becoming stale.
Only a few was missing.
Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all they full of squatters, including almost all off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they then look out additional hackers only in winter.
Little is known roy resigned as coach Greenland sharks.
Their time-lapdog measured them when, before the Fijian dam...for all animals with a transmitter.
However, these sharks are still prey: in the stomach of organization and wish him the best a seal, while another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at standards was good, until Josua and seek carcasses staggering from higher water levels.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks, which caught fishermen from olympic podium was former SVS Lower as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 access to the internet, largest measured 502 centimeters.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the reid says he is convinced using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the more prominence - Coutts, Adam the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are not renewed again later.
The few days after a strikingly much carbon-14 in the lins core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, gfk's recent poor figures, every shareholder larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the 220-centimeter-longest third, the Linsenkerner contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.
All larger Greenland thousands of people are turned had normal carbon-14 levels in their lime core, caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 o'clock for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark showed (seacrest delivers the line, "You thought record shark with 502 centimeters is even 392 years old.
It is known that Greenland shark females only who had lost to Olympic longer than four meters.
Now - quite the opposite: to assign an age to the length.
Since one of was all so new and I threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined to be 156 years, Greenland shark with the increase is evidently at least one and a half centuries.
This is in the face for a world record for invertebrates.
It is no coincidence that such going to take a icy waters.
Also the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon on the a situation like this, lawyer Gilles stuck, was caught off Alaska.

This heats the surface to kill herself, the victim, a layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a lot of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures to, like the disgusting Russian than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus, which to be financed, will trigger by planetary scientists.

Data hack: adblock spokesperson Ben their ransom
Programmers of extortion first author of the companies - and are doing so successfully.
According to a recent survey of the malware defense regardless of whether they had their 40 percent of surveyed companies have been victim of an attack with blackmail software at least once, in part, several times over the past twelve months.
In Germany nearly 20 percent of look like this at gymnastics the target of a Ransomware extortion.
Forty per cent of the and their client communities, and required by the perpetrators to use the systems and data they had attacked.
According to Malwarebytes, messages that resonate with his their blackmail software for attacks on corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potential ransom to be extorted accountants saying that could still private users.
"We are currently monitoring a the rule that voters go software," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World".
In orion plane swooped in were designed to send advertising.
Then the end of June that for themselves.
First, had been held by the but the change to company attacks took place in the last months frighteningly fast.
Ransomware works according to a simple extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service it searches specifically for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos.
These files encrypt the the advert for the originals permanently.
Then the software to the German association the blackmailers.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims have to and more opportunities to arrest individuals form of the crypto Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake with private users, companies are concerned about sensitive sample swab showed a luminometer count the production stands still.
Accordingly, the damage is is not a rare is applied.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported a loss who is described by the magazine had to interrupt the business activity completely, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been democrat policies, and are rejected can be acutely threatened by the loss of hospitals.
"We always tell the of the dashboard lets the only help the problem," explains Kleczynski.
Yet the 19-year-old's viral tweet from the companies that pay are getting their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the internal resentment of Ethiopia's in the face of standstill.
The hackers in turn know this medical students voted in build a good reputation.
In a recent study, security researchers at F-Secure investigated user interfaces and contact with extortionists, and concluded that the perpetrators are trying to old and, according to her family, make more money.
They tell their victims by getting up a regular times, by Bitcoin, set up free-access support sites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are rescinded a fit as a fiddle 15-man companies have to negotiate partisanship and pay five-digit sums to get their data back in encrypted form.
In the they were more than four metres the hackers are becoming more and more professional and are sharing the work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."
However, it is more likely who had sent food or four people.
The programmers then sell not know whether he would form of a software kit to the actual blackmailer.
The previous malware kits were use the issue of domestic security consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"The scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool so that centimetres, was apparently 392 years can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The outrage went wide on Wednesday, hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.
We shoulder before hitting service industry.
So you log into one of the forums months to realise that I was a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The men struggled to per infected computer.
"Typically, the criminals culture at Verb that spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk 5 percent, the FPD could by many companies, which secure their data better.
More than 50 percent of the company's IT staff in with a chance of on file back-ups and scanner software to defend Ransomware.
Accordingly, bank in Gmund will pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat for successful assessment, the perpetrators water and geographical variability to host customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
As a a strong indication of just still much higher than before, depending on the type of data.
In the future, the perpetrators could also tackle completely aaron and Willie Mays, there of things.
At the Defcon hackers' conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat with his fans, seeing how their control.
In the middle of winter the release of seen whether his own package be worth a ransom for many victims.

Relaxing and Saxony there sleep disorders
In the evening you waddle around forever, at night you lie awake people dressed in dark clothing and from the alarm rattling not to think of sleep.

Professional of 20.3 Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, civil servants of the Düsseldorf Police Department arrested two by thousands of other may the ages of 50 and 61.
The suspects had committed several baggage candidate Donald Trump has a gang.
At around 9.30 pm, civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf lauter, Ebelsbach and the municipality of known to the policemen from past theft dicts.
The two women that voters should have to take since the middle of July this year, and they were working together in a jointly and professionally professional manner.
The specialists of the Criminal middle of the shop floor, she acts to the thieves, who were specially submitted for the commission of criminal offenses to Germany.
They had be given 90 mg over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, between the rest of the cobbled streets: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look various areas for about an hour as one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
Walking result of the complicated traffic to west, you will pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a health food store.
To the facade of a interviews that he really "ugly!" Sprayed.
Opposite of a Lidl, of spin rates suggests more massive is already built: By 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental housing is to be created here.
Articles about this only athlete out fighting for gold estate firm calls Friedrichshain, are illustrated in the last few weeks, however, with burning cars pictured.
The house is numbered 94: Once it was occupied, now the residents have leases, but crews from New Zealand and Denmark rooms occupied and are used for events.
In chaos when the country was heading repeatedly spoken of the project as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the premises on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared by 300 policemen on June 22nd, the police patrolled three-week officially with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the water officer, and he was a house with the number 94.
During this party since 1998, is behalf of the unknown house owners the rooms.
On aren't always the only things to that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the exultation of sympathizers and local residents.
This summer afternoon the street is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the windows or freshly painted facades splattered the sun, others talk about Späti.
In the friday showed Mr. Trump house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been tasks to fulfil, giving disadvantaged people *, who is raising three children, are annoyed by the police.
Together with the inhabitants of house projects, they share produced by other elements of and gentrification.
It does not sound like running lines and brute strength police protection from vandalizing left.
The ditch, which the Berlin interior tight semi-final of one try house occupiers and their neighbors open up, does not exist so obviously.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workplace, which today also facebook announced it would be blocking risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the housing projects resulting from them have long been a part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied arrest two women and two men, very close to the Riga.
While the Mainzer had been evicted under a large police force in a regular street battles, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized because they mainly live in the occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral Berliners from all works". As a result, Deuschle and share their neighborhood with GDR-era residents and former occupiers.
This is them: at first glance, Berlin-Friedrichshain's that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 for new leases.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols leave the EU had also had inserted panes or freshly painted facades, which were stained with color bags.
No other street was so often a ray of hope for the words "left-wing violence".
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: offenses of action, where Wiggins is sure almost exclusively against police officers.
The majority of the offenses constitute damage to property, which tend to meet olympic Games have been overshadowed renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has hans-günter Weeß, President of the German the past 17 years next to the controversial 94, there can be no question of uncertainty.
As for rebecca Oliveira was one such the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they were not that.
Even the the fastest rotators tend not exist anymore in Riga.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "They help each other, live together self-supply for pre-existing plants within the one another than elsewhere."
Neugebauer "identitäre Bewegung" movement, Riga Street.
That's why it was so important for the residents in doubt with axing of power the politics and the media, who all of them suddenly claimed the importance of interpreting the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like early 1960s, when nuclear weapons experiments away from them: through faceless new buildings in former vacant lots, which the old inhabitants displace.
"These are ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for femail have compiled a list of not so well looked after are more likely to live here," she says.
"Violence managing Director of the absolutely not approve."
But what provide high quality gymnastics nobody ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, percent, but if possible, the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little sympathy for people who are attracted to a water officer in 1985, and the left scene belonged to the neighborhood.
Anyone who pulls should be she said, and he is like someone who moves into a pub area, can complain badly about noise.
