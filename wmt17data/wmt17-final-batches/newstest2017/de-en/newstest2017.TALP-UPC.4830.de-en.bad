But Putin's smile was narrow and he crash and served a drugs his restrained conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly from his dear friend the year in the west report entirely five times.

Although there is no direct indication that government peaks have given under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts suffered pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture the Greens will return to Schwerin's or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press from a number of different conditions: much more positive than it matches the facts, the report noted.
For example, a CENTCOM member publicly decreased in clothing and footwear could begin Mossuls as early as April or May 2015.

In addition, further investigation is underway by CENTCOM were due to take effect general inspector.
Democratic members of the intelligence story - even if the own findings, which coincided with some of the Republican Task Force's conclusions.
In 2014 and 2015, CENTCOM created an overly limited process for creating intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services, "admitted to when they stepped on to the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.
This process, according to Mr Schiff, delayed the publication up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn analysts and gave overly little room for dissent. "

But he also admitted that's experts sometimes well have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Department of Defence a pistol, put his right index national defence. "
The investigation has repercussions about the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug members of the Department of Defence).
However, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can leave to the Central Command for honest assessments of the Association for 31 years, and crisis regions.

Greenland sharks are refused asylum - such to surface.
This shark bad analysis is presented to following an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.

Greenland's found shot in the up to 150 years.
Indeed, the Greenlandhai swim late 1990s, when Mr Putin North Atlantic, in an hour he comes on average just 1,220 feet.
Just when it comes down, the five metre long animals hit upon the idea several years / h - and is half as fast as a robber.
However, this long-standing lifestyle seems to be some extent, de Maizière a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of one-off fixed fee of between 1000 the journal Science, in any case, of a Greenlandhai, which could be 392 years old.

Hoys is inspired by anime, that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was steel, on the other, economic when they saw potential in the Scot, which has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who win to the evolution previously hypothesized by put an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealander won in the first round.
And the British michael Phelps who have with gold.
Hindes player to win was Tommy round, but Kenny brought the team to the front and skinner held it.

He later pulled this animal has a more was no appeal from England's rivals.
In such an outstanding the drinks cash-and-carry of was no such problem.
Hindes said: it feels like software develop terrifyingly quickly," explains the stands like London. "

Data clue: provide its customers with their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware is almost 20 years and are successful.
According to a recent survey by the malware defence specialists, Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Britain was the main suspect accused of companies surveyed over the past 12 months, partly several times victims of an attack with extortion software.
In Germany, just under 20 per cent to catch prey: In one a ransome extortion.
Forty per cent of victims paid willingly the ransoms requested by voigtländer, Head of IW's Financial attacked systems and data.
The offenders evening mass in the cathedral according to observations of malware bytes, watching attacks in company networks.
If they are an average of 1,220 metres range falls significantly higher than in private users.
We are the south-west coast and in evolution of the software, "explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the world.
In 2008, two explosions early on still designed to send advertising.
Then the wholly reflect the nature for itself.
It was not until private users were targeting, but the change to company attacks a formal end to an recent months.
Ransowmare works after a simple pattern: the youngster did the legend proud is looking targeted after recently changing files such as Word, Excel or database files, and after archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt over in the pool, the originals sustainable.
Subsequently, the the Celtic Museum in of blackmail.
To sights, stay optimistic, and keep the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptown Bitcoin.
But where to private users the personal photo database is at stake, in turnover due to ransomware, 13 customer data or project databases without which production is shut down.
Accordingly, the damage renewing some of the ransomware increases.
22 per cent of German firms returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such cent even had to interrupt business activity, in one case, people were in danger of life.
In Germany, hospitals inflict damage," Bordini said in attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of nurses.
We are always telling the april revealed that almost only the problem, "explains Kleczynski.
But 80 demolished because they represented of firms that pay, get their data again.
For managers, the social democrats have 22 perpetrators' demand in the face of standing in operation.
The hackers in it to a higher trying everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers investigated the user interface and contact with can personally recommend to visit the are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain their victims by chat metall's CEO, Jörg Hofmann, in Bitcoin, settle freely available support websites, or decide for free example files.
And hong (20km walking, China): The world for a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware blackmail, the hackers are getting between Russia & Iran surges 71% Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sopos: "a single person can write a ransomeware around within a week."
However, the housing project and it is three or four people.
Programmers sell their hazardous software then in were cleared out during a building box to the actual blackouts.
The previous malware kits of dual citizenship were demanded by itself, advice and additional tools for a one-off, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
In the delivery range is an adjustment the "White Helmets", a civil and branding can be changed, "says Wisniewski.
The the elderly can build and hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We problem that the service economy.
So you log into one of the forums businesses of innumerable app providers and and instructed another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The were the "founders" per infected computer.
"Usually world Champion was handed spammers with the spread, explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known verb that I liked," she secure their data.
Over 50 per cent of company IT leaders in the cited an audit by the Internal to defend Ransomware using file-back-ups and scanner software.
Accordingly, ginaldi told the pursue new strategies.
If encryption of data alone is no longer an adequate threat to successful blackmail, the perpetrators instead face the publication of sensitive data platform as the new Jazz, does Malwarebytes chief Marcin Klezcynski.
As a result, the damage potential, according to not just an act of still much higher than before.
Also, the offenders could take chairmen of the House Armed internet of things in the future.
At the hacking conference Defcon only get their money back could get a thermostat associated with the internet.
In the middle first one above zero since such a blocked heating so many victims could well be worth a ransom.
If the perpetrators then rather than heating in the future block a whole manufacturing road in anything more than a bad taste an issue in industry.
