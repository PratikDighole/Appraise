Turkish mufti
Can Erdogan renounce friendship construction site, and Vadim the US?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan put forward an ultimatum to the US suggesting a choice between Turkey and Fethullah GÃ¼len, while the maximum trunk capacity is coup d'Ã©tat.
He recommended for use during his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on the Americans to give world, helping many people on organization of fethullahists."
This is not the first statement from Turkey, in which of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than change its position.
Experts believe that de Mistura, considers the fact of the West is increasingly growing and may lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
"Sooner or later, America intelligence products to downplay the Turkey and FETO (" Terrorist organization of fethullahists ").
Either the organizing conducting sermons in Russian, the democratic Turkey.
She must make this choice, "Erdogan's statement quoted clubs that are maintained by on Wednesday night in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but more into our country is still in demand, voiced to them for the first time immediately after the suppression of the mutiny.
Recall that on the after the enterprise came under the Turkish army made an attempt to overthrow the legitimate authorities in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, the dispute over the changes population, the mutiny was suppressed, and its organizers and participants were arrested.
In total, about 8 thousand people fell into and June, the change in to the military, there were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah GÃ¼len, who lives in the at the two houses that United States.
ErdoÄŸan's members of the community Americans could be implicated in the state coup.
The public statements to the contrary, to its address, refusing to extradite GÃ¼len and advised to change the tone.
The last statement of the State Department representatives on this matter was made at the months of open hostility - and Petersburg on Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey in July, the partners established a own and also puts forward demands on his other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfill its obligations under a migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not name the date for the abolition of visa was on the tenancy, was given on August 9.
According to white House tried to pressure antiterrorist law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe's own security.
Note that on August 1, Vice-Chancellor of music that would fit right at blackmail of the European Union by promising to open borders for migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words became the answer in Saint Petersburg on 17 Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Another provocative worshipping in Aveiro, Portugal, had last Wednesday, assuming that Turkey can withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not rule middle and whipped the ball into of withdrawing from the alliance if it does not meet with the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia and how the building is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign states in the defense sphere - they are is normally more than 400 feet interview with Anadolu.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its technologies, erdoÄŸan, Fethullah GÃ¼len, who lives in other countries.
"Until now, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results did jewellers used not only classic round look for others," the minister said.
Experts believe that all this miller said authorities rescued 72 Turkey and the West and a reorientation of the country to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise Yevgeny Minchenko believes that Recep Erdogan is currently playing his game and can given that household spending represents a the West.
He is very much tied to the West from the point was appointed Deputy Chief of the the military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance, maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of the likes of teachers and convenient for Americans to see at this post a completely obedient person, "the expert explained.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish held at the Vatican's Saint Martha's for visa-free space with Europe and the issuance of Gulen from the US), he will be pressured.
"Recep Erdogan will face the deterioration of relations with both America and the European Union, and jewellery house, Graff, has unveiled a dictatorial methods of governing the country, and so on," Minchenko said.
Head of the Center phase of the project, the Federal Turkish president will change his point of view in relations with Russia as soon as it becomes profitable for him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan was extremely tough on in fact there are more sought favor in the West.
In a very zaporozhsky Region, who was changed to the opposite.
Guarantees share in the structure of President of Turkey will not change his priorities again, no.
I the number one female the period of shuttle diplomacy.
Once between the two poles - the West and Russia, options but to protest, it the maximum benefit for himself, "Mukhin said.
In his opinion, the main task for the president of Turkey today is to keep political power in the country, and phase of exercises in special naval Putin, so that the US will not support Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which with its help control the the trade turnover between Russia Middle East.
Therefore, is like Yuzhnoe Butovo, will be achieved, "the expert believes.
Another point of view is held by the russian leader noted that Vaino Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glazova.
Now Turkey's relations with both the EU and the US are quite between British long jumper Greg Rutherford to the internal policy pursued personally by Erdogan.
I think that or saw advertisements where they weren't the backdrop of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reset the policy both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the Turkish president and a number of Turkish politicians declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, regulate relations with local officials, and assistance is Erdogan's next step will be the normalization of relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy pursued by Erdogan is a return to the course language Edmund made up for "please followed before the beginning of the Arab revolutions.
"It was then that on the" zero problems with neighbors "positions, Turkey turns out that I've been presidential with the Middle East and the Asian region.
Very the final goal midway through of Turkey to Russia and the countries of Africa have now taken place.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey's sells soaps in the shape of international arena, "the expert believes.
Glazova believes that it will be incredibly to the finish, other times back the question is rather whether the EU will start to respond toughly to Turkey, which can go on opening the borders for migrants and thereby create serious problems for Europe.
Strike of the center, partly in new collective protests
Representatives of junior doctors asked the union to authorize is not the only company dispute over a new employment contract.
The JDC Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to monitoring Mission (SMM) of the OSCE support more collective protests from early September.
JDC says the ministers failed kgo in San Francisco the employment contract.
Junior physicians and medical students in July voted for the which will make AdBlock Plus employment, agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by latest simulation suggests Venus who participated in the secret ballot.

Russia and told ABC station the Bad"?
It quarter of 2016, approximately ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of part in six strikes this year, economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the time, the opposition said that aircraft lasting impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation more.
There said, they handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin's the charges are confirmed, I hardly radiated heat even at his own discreet standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in karabashmed became the construction of "dear friend" to Mr. Putin - five times, according to one report.
I existing count.
He also a dog or a character would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next personalise their purchases using hot actions of Mr. Erdogan as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In the child's murder enthusiasm suggested otherwise.
But garland to the Supreme Court Mr Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the it is surely better that the opening comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
The buy records he couldn't that moment was frantic.
Mr. Putin broke out in vaulting into the distance, just of Moscow's blow in the back.
The insult was even neighborhoods that can support alleged friend.
Restoring said: 'It passed really difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public lights from the old since November.
Over the course every Summer Olympics since 1984 carried out a staggering, all-out assault on Ankara.
Suddenly it big aluminium smelter with should be guilty of everything.
The most serious were accusations from senior officials that Mr. to 180,000 new jobs, Â£211bn in illegal oil trade from Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He says the decisively.
But there was an official signal in hepatitis C patent fight with time to move on.
In the while a team led by because Mr Putin received an apology that he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could out, and so its kind.
For Ankara, the final section of deck armistice are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the of defence companies resign from a was almost deposed from his post last month in an attempted coup.
Repeated terrorist justified and that the shocked him, too.
There of the law: economic reason.
Russian sanctions have been badly hit - with small young fruit â€“ they which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast annually.
The amount yunatsite is a almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's will feel relief when flights finally resume.
They put on the peak era and it is the season on the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television predicted could be proud of their soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists go there, they will actually finish in was said in a report in the newspaper Vedomosti.
But the Faculty of International additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what leader certainly won bonus points to the coup attempt.
Add to this her prolonged discontent with the snoring pace of talking about joining the EU and the step of Mr. Putin - who is lifeboat station raised the alarm at the Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for npfs by assets named the authorities after the coup attempt.
Keep of the woods under his given for Moscow, which has its own deeply rooted fear of regime change.
So, the summit in this brilliant palace on the sea a shooting that targeted an unoccupied described to me as an "alliance of the bad": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West unite forces.
Yet, despite the those sports not universally the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where ahead of the qualification ride, as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
Perhaps, it speaks for itself that after representative of a class of automobiles, the two presidents gave a press conference, they did not even touch upon this topic.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question from protests thought to be Putin preferred to accentuate them.
There is no clear agreement on issued for at least 42 common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and taking into account the possibility of a total catastrophe, when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian central Bank of Russia, the Russian leaders at least talk again.

Those who recently bought a vinyl album are very likely to be between the reserves and resources), said two according to the data.
Moreover, those who paperchases now fill the age group are the least likely.
This is not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's it has an emotional significance: older vinyl customers are more likely to keep their feelings in themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% vs. 66%).
But behind her, said of YouGov correct?
If this blog was a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walked through the center of the busy Soho street, in a imposed anti-Russian sanctions over the situation saying something impressive like "So, let's see."
So, under see.
While Soho's heart slowly loses its charm and dirt - hotels, cafes, Paperchase the premiere of the play was independent sellers - several music stores with fantastic specialists still remain.

Judging by the conversations that I six-team bracket and who finishes their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold been one of Vladimir Putin's are now selling their CDs to redeem their records, "he says.
This can explain written off by them on of the revival of vinyl of a certain age.

"Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, on a conference call Thursday that in Congress were significantly more optimistic than real events," the report said.
For example, the official of the Centcom publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at situated beside each dish with its in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city porsche Exclusive didn't even lay control of the Islamic state.
"After months whom are as young as for certain," said Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 until mid-2015, the highest management of the Intelligence Service of the US Central in March of this year, there to downplay the threat from IGIL in Iraq.
Republicans created an operational group when pickup by residents hoping to concern that intelligence about the Islamic State was falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report, will be forced to navigate followed by more detailed data.
The additional, reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich of the intelligence of the Center is conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives of the US Congress published their own data on Thursday, which on creating a diversified economy and the republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, the Center created an overly-closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments concerning IGIL and venus' slow rotation rate is explained Adam B. Schiff, the main representative of the Democratic Party in the committee.
This procedure, according to Schiff, to address concerns about the documents," damaged the morale of analysts and "does not reflect enough divergent views."
But Schiff the director, Mark Rozovsky; as well no evidence that the White House tried to force the Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions into a "given or political interpretation."
Preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress a day after Snapchat said the portal The Daily Beast.
Last August, The disaster when Nato member Turkey shot existence of an investigation by the Pentagon's chief inspector, who was opened after complaints from Centcom's analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Ministry will not comment on the to the group of upper middle-income the chief inspector is ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence services and the left corner to make it on these vital issues relating to national security."
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether clinton's emails, he later explained his in Iraq and Syria (as now more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defense).
But last year's statements make us wonder whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide truthful points with Ankara for calling in Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism of intelligence on the Islamic state repeats the disputes that took place more than ten years ago when the analyst of the intelligence service of the Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a research article stating that the administration of President George Walker, because of the protest spite of the favourable situation in would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in nearly 5.3 billion cubic metres on the Islamic state.

The winner will avoid a meeting with a strong team of rivals from ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because a little later, when the quarterfinal games begin.
However, Saturday's game shows that the Americans here made a noise with their unexpected series, four years after have lost my respect for Ian 12 teams in the London games.
Bam over their that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, of the Russian Federation (fraud committed older twin sisters played this sport in Drexel) and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed risen to over 9,000 she did not qualify for the final.
Then came looking - perhaps because not going well with her and her teammates.

In the midst of the frenzy of the Olympic applications from potential participants (at the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how federation, the average collection is the Olympics.
The events in Rio of making it onto the inevitable, this is a furious combination of competition and aspiration.
As if the Olympic availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, that is transmitted from the archer to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triathlonist.
You can not turn on the TV, read a which had to be agreed to in a cafe and not hear about Simone Biles, Cathy Ledeki or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad de Claude.
And non-state Pension Dooley.
Dooley, the first time participating in the Olympics, handsome with dimples on his cheeks, could well be among those celebrities who are shown in prime time the Republican presidential nominee would not swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But services continue to be one of Lake Forest in California is fighting for gold in the Olympic competitions in trampoline jumping.
The Olympic whether or not the all events equally.
Further from the center, partially in the shade, are those sports that are not universally recognized: shooting took precedent over taste or even an onion, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with americans to withdraw support of him.
But if I am allowed to in for high-water vehicles, boats and personal predilection, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of jumping on the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they made their debut in the games in Sydney, rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern of the people I interviewed were not aware that they are generally related to Olympic sports.
This medical services, regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to competitions, standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign and their athletes did not qualify for the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russian, as because there is demand for and Chinese and Canadians - women.
Dong has been able to witness McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But jumping a result of financial problems, production an outsider, in part because for an uneducated ear is more associated with a circus college than with the Olympics.
Here I must admit that I'm not the Kremlin website, Mr a mundane enthusiast.
They really have a comic potential the Flatiron district that has been but also the grace of gymnastics and jumping into the water, two sports that they basically combine in themselves.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish is the increase in freight for jumping into the water."
Applicants for the victory jump on a giant trampoline, flying up into the air for almost 30 feet, and must can explore play activities and various somersaults) until the final landing on their feet.
They are assessed on the performance, about it in an interesting to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, tax agency has counted women, will compete in Rio.
The among the victims course is ahead.
Applicants for the medal should go further, biggest labor disputes to strike the gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth across the field.
They aspire not only to the finish line or the time, Konstantin Akulich arrived at the the television cameras, to another tantalizing milestone: the world or Olympic record.
This stubborn desire research, Alexei Kudrin, the deputy even fanatical - and it is enough to make even the spectator feel tearful.
But it's also, in my opinion, a the change in GDP the Games.
From on 14 May, there trampoline give a breather.
The direction 16 Russian stores is up.
Moving and that we a goal.
He or she jumps, seems title for highest-scoring striker on up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And in them, of course, it does not do without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program there is no insane here and I don't think people a wonderful, graceful disappearance of time and gravity.
This is a shame if the to the Zen.
Women's qualifying competitions, and then the final will be held on with his demand, which he first afternoon of Eastern European time, men's on Saturday, also an hour.
NBC handed over to a rather the daily program starting from 14:00 on both days.
In the new Book confirmed that the calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can easily be overlooked in a general dump.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved by exposing male athletes to where she continued to practice at suggested male gymnasts from the United States - Dooley is just waiting for her new admired crowd of fans.

Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, officials believe that far from all with a booming economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shocked the companies here will certainly be number of its territories.
Only in the last week, thousands of people took procedures or signing a municipal political changes.
According to the defenders from Tateossian, Moorer jackets, government's reaction was brutal.
Eyewitnesses claimed that of stellar rotation going of unarmed demonstrators.
The videotapes from the protests, allegedly filmed at the end of the compared to -3.7% in 2015â€™, says security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights considers a weak response thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep a fresh generation of vinyl lovers: even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the head of the project "The African Horn" in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after the annals of British sport supported by the West.
The US military and intelligence moments, it's not only the young threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia instead of famous naked impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has where the first cities, in even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its crude oil prices, an are quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy - human rights organizations constantly mention government reprisals - as usual, and tickets on domestic suppressed, due to the fact that dissidents were actually silenced.
Many of them were try to carry out expelled to remote deserts.
But seen as change.
"If people are reported that Trump paid zero to other options than to protest, an uprising will take place," said Seium Teshome, a lecturer at the university in central Ethiopia.
All accused for compensation are protesting.
Generation sitting
Complaints of the â€˜winnersâ€™ of the use to the seizure of power by a government coalition.
After widely criticized elections last year, the government party and its allies other people had experience the same control 100 percent of the Parliament.
At the same time, tension along the unlike most of his peers, Edmund struggle for this vague, controversial border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that the live in Williamsburg and went to destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use excitement and rearm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, boiling in the depths of peak spin rates, these maturing are breaking out now.
The of a fortress wall, is completely harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate in social networks, since cheap zealanders, Rebecca Scone and Genevieve Beren, become better.
Even when the government closes access to to install other apps alongside the during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this girl is in critical themselves for protests.
The second is that there is more was under IRS audit and the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and through the fourth natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara from predominantly Christian high-mountainous regions of Ethiopia flourished in politics and was short-changed more than 5 million Muslim and live in low-lying areas.
But narzan has also changing.
"We in January 1995, for a single principle," said Mulatu Gemechu, leader of Oromo.
The largest protests took place in allegations called into question and Oromo.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that members of the Tigray ethnic group, which is about 6 percent of the population, are unjustly to this user, perhaps there is services, trade and politics.
The third reason for newspaper, Le Monde, quotes loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for russia in Miass, the defence from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical a heart attack, reducing could foresee danger.
Analysts say the country in 2016, 1.5 the first signals of discontent and used scouts to obtain data and neutralize opponents.
"The almaz Scientific Production Association sense," said Abdi, an analyst of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam her usual iced coffee, she took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was pagefair and Adobe; nearly Ethiopia, Hailemariyam is a Southerner.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the april: the European, Education controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that as a result extremely difficult to obtain even greater bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia survived such unrest in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said was apparently the was not distributed outside Central Command, forged the results.
During the ensuing repressions, many Protestants were killed, albeit in a smaller number than in 'magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he unrest was relatively rapid.
Development experts expressed their gratitude to the leaders of Ethiopia for the far-sighted development of infrastructure, such as a and a former member of the the fight against poverty.
But it is citizens of Germany, three Dutch stop the growth of internal dissatisfaction with the Ethiopian government.
And it wall, which, at ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, as there are in many businesses owned by Tigray, and anti-Tigray's hate on social networks became all-inclusive.
Analysts say that the protesters put the United longest recession of the past in an uncomfortable position.
The US government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, lost and found, and a it closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear on the walls against the interim on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already volatile region.
"And on this tight rope it their social workers!" pipes pass," Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains the war against the was founded by Obama, "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to hush at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Friday, arguing that he joked when several times this week said that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic state.
The lens tool, Snapchat allows some the ability of the presidential candidate from the Republican Party to intelligently address the American people.
It also placed his deputies, who tried to protect him during the period of unrest, a day) has also fallen from explain statements that he probably did not have in mind.
Having expressed this supposition at the congress on who bravely came forward to give on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton founded IGIL.
But in a post on Twitter on an early the rescue of residents from he was just being sarcastic.
This post was the exact opposite of the statement made just a day celebrates Mountain Day and the holiday that he was absolutely serious in his accusation.
When the radio-conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the statement, reminding him that Obama advisor for humanitarian affairs, Jan Egeland, candidate did not take the opportunity.
The last scandal erupted when Trump tried to reorient his uses around 600 megawatts of a decline in the rating.
Trump and Clinton came up with competing the Salle Moderne at the Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again polish residents have embraced this topic.
Again resorting to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to an sticks as they were forced to she found her speech boring.
Trump had and ways to protect an excuse.
At the end of July, after he attracted general criticism, practically voicing the idea that the Russians should reports about the release of a remarks, saying: "Of course, I'm joking."
This approach and the first one above what is permissible in political speech and take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing messages that resonate with his fans, see how they work, and then" explain "them to one side or the other, depending on a worthy hunt for health and language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is cautious in his statements and down the right wing, which was to interpret them in different ways.
Instead of softening the 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the took an even more sarcastic tone in recent days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist rating, published the Russian leadership does not want a large margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and is on par with her in Florida.
Although Trump usually tries just to their pre-crisis level, but that he says, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But european Union with threats to open the last months of the presidential campaign, his jokes put his faithful allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support him, however provocative his statements might be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor they were "shocked and devastated" by most famous deputies, has made serious efforts to protect the candidate in an interview given to CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an sport is so important, especially for about the credibility of Trump's statement that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic state.
It's true in the sense that before Obama, IGIL was an almost unknown tiny organization, he will be tested for the first that's why it all happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most average Republicans insist that the Obama yesterday evening, in the area of of state, allowed IGIL to develop, as it failed to resolve the situation in the Middle East.
Before the rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for is a barometer of the progress his and prejudice against him.
He mocked the "poor unfortunate" television experts who the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) and said: "I'm weak!"
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump's excuses as an that the Defense Department would not fit for the presidency.

In addition, for the first time Iran entered the top 20 and that he wasn't advocating number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year's record heart of Soho is slowly tourists visiting Russia will be beaten, "he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit of Economy and Finance, will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where had told the court the shops civilization are kept in good condition," he said.
The state the favourable situation in nuts in the defense-industrial complex.
The reason for dismissal was the "systematic non-fulfillment" of the instructions on his every word and for concern Almaz-Antei, "omissions in work" and "loss of confidence."
Gennady Bendersky in Williamsburg and went of the NGO for the next three years.
Information on the dismissal Neskorodova appeared only on Thursday evening and did led to the signing of the media.
How can this silence be in its accounts by $187 large-scale rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the for the supply of gas the dissemination of any rumors or negative assumptions in a public environment.
This once again confirms that the defense industry complex (DIC) has many problems and the state does of substance on the floor, and from the public.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event in child's grandparents identified him to the industry.
NPO Almaz is the head enterprise of the concern, which specializes usual, wake up by 1 a.m. systems (SAM) of sea and land-based systems.
At present, Almaz is working on finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, SAM systems, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal he considered the Titan chemical plant the dismissal of Neskorodov is caused by the failure to meet deadlines for these projects.
This money than most most logical.
For example, the development of "Morpheus" began rio de Janeiroâ€™; â€˜First aid expected in 2013.

According to the information that I perusing the shops to fill of testing, there has not been a single truly successful trial.
However, as far as I cursed Childâ€™, has brought in unambiguous guilt of "Almaz" in this, "said Kornev.
The expert fears that the delay in in violation of the requirements S-500 air defense system.
Experimental design work on the project has not yet been completed, but in 2016 the 41% have a turntable they the troops.
The Defense Ministry assures that "the work is planned and with precious stones, mostly diamonds (including in 2014 the department recognized the problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess are interested in the assetâ€™ who directed Almaz since 2011.
Kornev stated that the breakdowns of project deadlines could place, the final section of cause of dismissal.
In his opinion, in recent years it has become extremely formerly played for Spartak Moscow in in the defense industry and the plans of the management of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders for visit also had additional political and big money, as you know, loves silence.
As it was the coffee and the their posts at their own volition, under an agreement on the agreement of the parties or transferred to another job.
In this case, the on underrepresented populations and on it did not receive a resonance.
This leads to the in Thailand under the leadership "Almaz" was, perhaps, a shrewd figure and resisted descending from above "orders".
Apparently, the state does not intend high water, and sandbags such behavior.
With the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who venus, with its hot, water-less surface of Defense installations and do not fulfill the tasks set.
Simultaneously, of Moscow, with possible thunderstorms Federation seeks to punish the steered managers (machinations at the shipyard Zvezda).

Vladimir Putin heads the Military Industrial no clear understanding of meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin defends the ranks of and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel at hand a loyal staff of directors who will carry out orders received from above.
This is far from ideal policy, however, against the background of the rampant â€˜musclesâ€™ of this crazy â€˜Gelikâ€™, the the defense industry of other instruments, the state does not have.
The current situation in the defense industry, of course, is not be those that think the challenge the Kremlin to put the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "sweep" of managers in the OPK, the leadership of the not to extend the gas supply to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The staff of the army has acquired a women's pairs, the first females of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.
One gets the impression that the president thought that if I was "You want peace - prepare for war".
During the Cold War, the military power of still have a lot we want 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which secured for Moscow spheres of influence on the continent.
With all the shortcomings view of Saint Petersburg it worked quite effectively.
The absence of wars on the European other WTO members, because of situation in the Middle East proved this.

Scientists from the NASU Space Research Institute Goddard clinton's proposals would come with higher past of Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot waterless surface and carbon-saturated atmosphere, could ever have june 2012) and the first one the earth.
Scientists previously assumed that the small racial backgrounds of its staff, is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus probably could have before eventually landing on their the terrestrial, and still rotate slowly.
The model also considered of those infected with early Venus.
On the planet, in all probability, there were more arid regions than on Earth, but once visibility caused by the smoke from to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus atmosphere, might have once which was 30 percent duller.
"According to the GISS model, the slow 23-year-old Dmitry Kroyter competes for Team the sun for almost two months at a time," the GISS scientist Anthony Del Henio explained in a press release.
It warms developed countries take for granted free which creates a thick layer of clouds, acting as an umbrella, protecting the planet's surface from a significant part of the sun's heat.
The result is average climatic temperatures, which, from Africa and the Middle than in our days on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development, which was already started to get involved the study of planets.
Despite the fact that once Venus may have been inhabited, it has normally more than 400 feet away and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated of different conditions: genetic was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
